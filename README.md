VF-CDAAS Workflow Templates for github actions
You can create a standardized set of workflow templates specifically for your organization. Organization members can then use the templates when creating new workflows in the organizations repositories.
Workflow templates can be created by users with write access to the organization's .github repository. The templates can then be used by organization members who have permission to create workflows.

Workflow templates can be used to create new workflows in an organizations' public repositories; to use templates to create workflows in private repositories, the organization must be part of an enterprise or GitHub One plan.
